# SQL_100-Days

Hey everyone! ðŸŒŸ

Iâ€™m excited to announce that Iâ€™m starting a 100-day challenge where I will tackle SQL problems every day, covering a range of difficulties: easy, medium, and hard. These problems are sourced from top company interviews for roles such as Data Analyst, Business Analyst, Data Scientist, and Data Engineer.

Iâ€™m confident that this challenge will be an excellent opportunity to sharpen our SQL skills and enhance our problem-solving abilities. Whether you're just starting out or looking to refine your expertise, joining this journey could be incredibly beneficial!

Follow along, and letâ€™s learn and grow together. ðŸ’ª
